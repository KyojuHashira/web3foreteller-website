                <td>Web3 ForeTeller generates a random "salt" based on events from the Web2 and Web3 worlds, then combines it for the best result. The final step adds some magic and gives users the answer they need!</td>

                <th>Question:</th>

            <tr>
                <th>Answer:</th>
                <td>Clicking on the "Altruistic Answer" button calls the getRandomNumber() function, which returns a random value free of charge by fetching a random salt from the Web3 and Web2 worlds. This method works well but is not as powerful as the 'Burn some gas!'. Clicking on the "Burn some gas!" button triggers calls to the getRandomNumberWithGas() and getRandomSaltFromGasBurn() functions, which generate more web3 salt. This interaction allows the Web3 ForeTeller to gain better insight into your aura and provide a more accurate response! "Burn some Gas!" fee ~ $0.05.</td>

                <td>Web3 Foreteller had its first local launch (with Denwer + Apache) on July 28th, 2023. It started serving people from the moment the Base Mainnet GA was launched. However, for the most curious, the backend was available from the beginning. Web3 ForeTeller will continue to serve people until it deems that its help is no longer needed.</td>
